# CLox Hash Table

CLox VM implements a hash table to efficiently search for and add variables using their variable names. The hash table
is also used to retrieve and add class instance fields, providing fast access and manipulation of these data structures.

A hash table associates a set of keys with a set of values. Each key/value pair is an entry in the hash table. The
primary advantage of a hash table is its ability to quickly locate a value given its key, which is achieved through the
use of a hash function. Additionally, hash tables can dynamically add new key/value pairs and delete entries by their
key, making them flexible and efficient for various data management tasks.
